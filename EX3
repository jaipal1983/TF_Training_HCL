Question1

Create a security group named as "your name" and add the inbound port as 22 and 80 and add all port in outbound. 
Once the security group is created, it should be automatically attached to an ec2 instance of "ubuntu 22" image and the name of ec2 instance must be "yourname"
Also create an key pair which should be attached to the aws instance so that you can login via the terminal.
Once the task is done, public ip and public dns of aws_instance must be printed on the screen. You can reefr output variable for that.
Also, define local for multiple tags as "type=prod" and "server=web" and make sure they are applied on the ec2 instance.
Make sure that you are defining variable for ami id and instance type and call them in aws_instance resource. Variable values must be taken from terraform.tfvars
Note - Command to login to ec2 is "ssh -i <location of private key> ubuntu@IP

Question2

1) Destroy everything which you have created in question 1.
2) You need to declare a variable as "region" and do not define any value for it.
3) You need to define a map as below
  us-east-2 = ami id of amazon linux
  us-west-1 = ami id of ubuntu
  ap-south-1 = ami id of ubuntu
4) When you give region while running terraform plan command, if the region is ap-south-1, the ami id from the defined map should be taken automatically and ec2 instance
   must be created. make sure that 80 port is allowed on the instance. once instance is created login to the instance and setup a nginx server and make sure when
   you hit the public ip in browser, it should give you nginx default page.
